Practice project

Bullet-hell style game made completely in Java. 
Started by following a simple tutorial on YouTube. 


GamePlay: User controls two portions connected by a damage-dealing tether, using WASD and the arrow keys. 
  Enemies spawn randomly until a large boss unit appears which moves back and forth at the top of the screen. 
  Collision of either portion of the character other than the tether deals damage to the player. 
  Collision of enemies with the teather will destroy the enemy.
